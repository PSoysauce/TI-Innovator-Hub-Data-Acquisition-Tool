# Things to do
Familiarize with GUI Composer Tool
The target hardware for the GUI is a microcontroller board from TI called MSP432 LaunchPad (Part number MSP-EXP432P401R). This same hardware is used in the product called TI-Innovator Hub. In the beginning of the project we will use the LaunchPad for practice and then try to get the GUI running on the TI-Innovator Hub after the features have been finalized.
Run through tutorial material for XDS demo to create first GUI
Read through User Guide and experiment with different GUI components
Add functionality to the base tutorial
 
The software team is going to focus on the GUI development. Starting with TI GUI Composer, you will showcase a proof of concept. Next you will determine if sticking with GUI Composer is going to be the viable option or if other options are necessary to complete the GUI. You will proceed to improve the GUI demo to meet the project objectives and interface with the TI-Innovator Hub.
